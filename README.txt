What do to:

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER!

Either find a branch with an existing fort or create your own branch from master to start a fort.

The wiki is your best friend:

If you change the graphics style from ASCII please revert it before committing changes!

Branching strategy:
Start with master, create a new branch with your name or your fort's name.
Every "turn" (some amount of in-game years, lets start with 2) commit your changes. Include any fun stuff in the commit message.
